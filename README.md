A school board hired a consulting firm to analyze student data because of suspected academic dishonesty.  [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/acfthomson/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/students_complete.csv) shows evidence of reading and math grade for Thomas High School ninth graders appears to have been altered.  The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty , and in order to uphold state testing standard, they have hired this firm for help.

The analysis conducted compares previous school district analysis against this firm's analysis in order to determine how the suspected academic dishonesty affects school performance.

The school board has requested the following deliverables:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on the budget per student
    - School performance based on the school size 
    - School performance based on the type of school
